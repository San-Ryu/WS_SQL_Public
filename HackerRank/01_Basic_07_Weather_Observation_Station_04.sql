Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

For example, if there are three records in the table with CITY values 'New York', 'New York', 'Bengalaru', 
there are 2 different city names: 'New York' and 'Bengalaru'. 
The query returns 1, because Total Number of Records - Number of Unique City Names = 3 - 2 = 1
