where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

-- Sample Input
For example, CITY has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY.

-- Sample Output
ABC 3
PQRS 4

-- Explanation
When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths 3, 3, 4 and 3. The longest name is PQRS, but there are 3 options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.
